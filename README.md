# TimeLapse
A time lapse app for Sony Alpha cameras using the [OpenMemories: Framework](https://github.com/ma1co/OpenMemories-Framework).

I have only a a6300 to test it, if you have another camera I would be happy to receive bug reports.

## Installation ##
Use [Sony-PMCA-RE](https://github.com/ma1co/Sony-PMCA-RE) or install through [sony-pmca.appspot.com](https://sony-pmca.appspot.com/apps).

Thanks to [ma1co](https://github.com/ma1co) for creating this amazing framework and [obs1dium](https://github.com/obs1dium), I used FocusBracket as a code base.

## Usage ##
The app is easy to use. It doesn't have any controls for shutter speed, aperture, ISO, picture quality etc. Adjust all this settings before starting the app, it will use them. If you don't want the camera to focus before each shot, set the camera to manual mode.

Then start the app set the shoot interval and the amount of pictures it should take. The delay slider can be used to delay the start of the timelapse recording (set to zero to start immediately). Below the seek bars you can see how long it will take to shoot all the photos and how long the video will be. The fps setting only changes the calculation of the video length, the app doesn't produce a video.

Finally click the start button and wait.

You can stop by clicking the MENU button on the camera.

## Silent Shutter ##
The silent shutter option is functionless on cameras without silent shutter mode.

## AEL ##
This locks the exposure to the exposure of the first shot.

## BRC3 ##
The app supports exposure bracketing. Set the mode to three-image exposure bracketing outside of the app and check BRC3 checkbox in the app. The app will always take three pictures. Keep in mind that the interval time must be large enough to take all three pictures.

## Burst mode ##
When selecting the lowest interval the camera is in burst mode. In this mode it takes pictures as fast as it can write to the SD card for the duration set by the second slider.

## Known Issues ##

If the app crashes the camera, please try the following camera settings. They were reported to work with the RX100 M4.
 - The silent shutter needs to be disabled or unchecked in the app, on some cameras
 - If it doesn't work in single shoot mode, please try continous shooting. It worked for some people.
 - Long exposure noise reduction should be turned off if the interval is less than double the shutter speed.
